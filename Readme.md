# Data Structures & Algorithms practice in TypeScript

## Introduction

This is practice repo for Udemy course
[Master the Coding Interview: Data Structures + Algorithms](https://www.udemy.com/course/master-the-coding-interview-data-structures-algorithms/) purely written in Typescript.

## Dev Setup

#### pre-requisite : node/deno installed

- using vs code (with prettier, eslint and typescript support installed)
- using eslint for code standard and prettier for formatting
- using (node + ts-node) or deno to run program files

## Will add test cases for testing program files

## Main Topics

### How to measure code/program quality?

#### Time complexity

- how much time needed to execute program as we increase input
  (input can be anything, and our code will perform operations on input)
- We express time complexity of code in terms of Big-O notation.
- O(1) - Big-O of one : _constant time_ --> will take same time to execute irespective of input
- O(n) - Big-O of N : _Linear time_ --> execution time will increase linearly as we increase input
- O(n^2)- Big-O of N-square : _Quadratic time_ --> execution time will increase quadratically(to the square of input) as we increase input

#### space complexity

- how much memory need for executing the program
